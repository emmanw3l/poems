        There was no hint of hesitation <br />
        Or a sign he could change his mind <br />
        Just a glimpse of determination <br />
        And brutal murder in his eyes
      </p>
      <p>
        As he slowly crept forward <br />
        His figure hidden in the dark <br />
        He trailed a lovely lady, not too distant nor too far <br />
        She'd occasionally stumble and he'd want to leave his mark <br />
        But she'd gain her composure and he'd wait and bid his time .
      </p>
      <p>
        This kept happening on and on, <br />
        And it seemed she'd finally fall <br />
        But her legs kept her going <br />
        Angering her shadow even more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just when he was about to flip, <br />
        And throw caution to the wind <br />
        She walked into an alley <br />
        Making her shadow grin <br />
        He walked in right behind her, <br />
        Shocked at what he'd saw
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no trace of the fair lady stumbling on her feet <br />
        Like she transformed into the woman staring down at him <br />
        It was then that it all clicked <br />
        This wasn't her normal routine <br />
        She played him from the beginning <br />
        And he fell hard for her tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reaching out behind him, he tried to grab his <i>stick</i> <br />
        But the woman's moves were smoother as she threw a ball at him <br />
        The world slowed to a crawl as it hit him in his spleen <br />
        He bowled over in pain <br />
        Then realized his mistake <br />
        He was at the perfect angle to be shot at in the brain <br />
        No sooner had he thought it <br />
        That reality agreed, <br />
        A muffled gunshot sound <br />
        And he dropped there in a heap. <br />
        Reality is often cruel and karma is a bitch <br />
        They say she always comes back <br />
        And his came back to kill
