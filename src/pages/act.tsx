      <p>
        we're all unpaid actors on this giant set <br />
        With unknown scripts and no character depth <br />
        There's no background character or main character <br />
        We all have our own stories and they intertwine with one another
      </p>
      <p>
        There's no character arc, it's all a fa√ßade <br />
        The human mind is fickle, it can change at anytime <br />
        Our actions are influencable, the results undetermined <br />
        Our thoughts indescernible, it changes on a whim <br />
        The earth is a giant machine and we all are tiny gears, a fraction do
        not fit in, they're not where they're supposed to be while many just
        aren't working, thinking they set themselves free
      </p>
      <p>
        There are gears of different sizes, which represents our impact <br />
        The higher your range of influence, the more you get to impact <br />
        Some people are indisposable, while some work best when they're gone{" "}
        <br />
        And some don't even work at all, they should have been gone from day one
      </p>
      <p>
        Influence varies in different ways, <br />
        The good, the bad and sometimes gray <br />
        Nothing is perfect, nothing can't change <br />
        Nothing lasts forever, no matter how great <br />
        Would you leave a mark <br />
        Or would you just be washed away ? <br />
        Along with many other people who couldn't pave a way <br />
        There's so much that is going on, <br />
        So much that's at stake <br />
        Vital gears are falling out, and it's worsening by the day
      </p>
      <p>
        The play is slowly unravelling, the end is drawing near <br />
        We are all unpaid actors, and this is our set.
