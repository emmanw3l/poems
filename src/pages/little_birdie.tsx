        A little birdie once asked me <br />
        “Hey, why are you so lonely?” <br />
        I smiled and shook my head and said <br />
        “You wouldn’t get it, you’re free as a bird, <br />
        You got your whole flock with you <br />
        So loneliness is not an issue”
      </p>
      <p>
        To which it replied, <br />
        “it may not be, <br />
        But I know many people doesn’t mean they know me, <br />
        We flock together but don’t roll together <br />
        We might be a clique, but don’t know each other, <br />
        All I’m saying is you can be lonely in a crowd <br />
        So don’t let numbers deceive you, <br />
        I’m as lonely as you are <br />
        But I’m actively working to fix it, <br />
        Instead of moping like you are <br />I want to actually make a
        difference”
      </p>
      <p>
        I sat and thought about it <br />
        The bird was actually helping <br />
        If I didn’t work on my esteem <br />
        My loneliness would always plague me <br />
        So I thanked the little birdie <br />
        Before it went on it’s next journey <br />
        Thy say a dog’s a man’s best friend <br />
        But in my case, it’s this little bird
