      Is this love or a fixation or was he a figment of my imagination, <br />
were we real or a simulation, cause what we shared was beyond my wildest expectations <br />
he felt so much like a temptation that I just had to make a declaration <br />
I was struck with infatuation for someone I had never met on any occasion  <br />
he was a healthy distraction from the pain of my mental laxation

      </p>
      <p>
      we talked and communicated moving faster than I would have expected  <br />
love was in the air and I was clearly infected almost as if a love potion I ingested.

      </p>
      <p>
      we made a lot of calls, we were both heavily invested <br />
we wanted things to work, we were most definitely interested <br />
distance was a barrier that we initially neglected  <br />
until things got real and we needed to meet in person

      </p>
      <p>
      cyber dating sucks and I'd be the first to admit it <br />
breaking up would hurt, distance is a real bitch <br />
but then there was a silver lining, almost as if fate had willed it <br />
he was moving out and just so happened to move to my city <br />
we were both in luck, who would've thought a day would come <br />
where we could both meet regularly, not just via video calls

      </p>
      <p>
      In hindsight I should have suspected something wrong was going on <br />
but I was too excited to care, I couldn't wait to see my love <br />
I wanted to help unpack, but I couldn't put him on the spot <br />
cause if I went, it would mean I was forcing things to rush 

      </p>
      <p>
      But instead we decided to go on a date, <br />
I would show him around the city and then we'd go to his place  <br />
a week after he came here and today was the day <br />
I would finally get to meet him, and I could tell it'd be great <br />
so I picked up my phone, and on it was his face <br />
he was calling me for him to see just where we would meet  <br />
or so I thought when I picked up,  <br />
till I heard the tone of his voice he was going to be late and thought we should cancel the tour <br />
I was sad, I was looking towards this day for so long  <br />
I guess I would have to postpone the day I met my true love

      </p>
      <p>
      Then he suggested an idea which I said yes to  <br />
he asked if I could come,  <br />
I said "I'd be there in a few" <br />
he gave me his address and I internally screamed for joy,  <br />
his house was only twenty minutes away

      </p>
      <p>
      so I walked instead of taking my car to clear up my head <br />
I couldn't drive, not in this state of mind, my head was a mess <br />
I got to his house with ten minutes to spare  <br />
from the original time I thought I'd actually get there <br />
I knocked on his door with jittery fingers,  <br />
I knew he'd be there <br />
the man I had come to admire, his presence was near, he was my strongest desire <br />
he opened up the door for me and I stuttered like hell  <br />
I couldn't say any words, I just stared like a deer

      </p>
      <p>
      He ushered me into his house and I sat on a chair <br />
and took in my surroundings, his house was a massive affair <br />
I slowly started getting light-headed and at first I thought it my nerves <br />
till I began getting dizzy, I feared what was next.

      </p>
      <p>
      He walked into the room with a gas mask on his face  <br />
I could barely utter the words "why did you gas up your place?" <br />
he said what I could only decipher as "you made a mistake, <br />
Never trust someone you meet online, their lives could be fake"
