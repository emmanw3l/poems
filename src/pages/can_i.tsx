      <p>
        Buried beneath a pile of my own insecurities, <br />
        Overthinking everything to the point of anxiety, <br />
        Feeling like I’m at the centre of the world with billions of eyes on me,{" "}
        <br />
        Even though realistically, I’m just a random person on the street <br />
        with no eyes that are watching me or ears that are eavesdropping, <br />
        Nobody that’s looking at me wondering what I’m thinking, <br />
        I’m all alone yet I feel I’m not, cause whenever I round a corner,
        someone always comes along, <br />
        I might be crazy, but most likely not, one thing’s for sure- <br />
        I’m paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paranoid to the point of insanity, <br />
        Constantly watching everybody around me, <br />
        Feeling they’re all watching me back, <br />
        But fail to spot any eyes on me <br />
        Paranoid to the point of insomnia, <br />
        Letting crazy thoughts keep me up at night, <br />
        Paranoid to the point of skepticism, <br />
        Lacking belief of the world I find myself in, <br />
        Paranoid to the point of extremity, <br />
        Dialling my emotions up to eleven.
      </p>
      <p>
        A stranger to myself even when I look in the mirror, <br />
        Can’t recognise who I am due to extreme dissociation, <br />
        Can’t tell you who I am today and confused as to who I’m to be tomorrow
