        As the waves lap by my feet, <br />
        a distorted image is all I see. <br />
        A reflection but not one of me <br />
        my past self is the one I see.
      </p>
      <p>
        The old me, that didn't feel lonely, <br />
        that never did shit and wasn't broken. <br />
        The old me, that wasn't so deadbeat <br />
        had love in his heart and wasn't so empty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wasn't a shell like I am with no feelings <br />
        he was fun and had joy and was so carefree, <br />
        that was me years ago before life hit me <br />
        and the pain that I felt, it changed all these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I stare into my eyes that hold no emotion, <br />
        the holes through which I see a soul that has been broken, <br />I
        wonder is this me, when did I become broken?
      </p>
      <p>
        I let life get to me, hence this feeling of distortion <br />
        I wish I could go to sleep, but this feeling is a torture <br />
        and it's making me feel numb and so devoid of all emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        will I survive or become another lost cause? <br />
        this I know not but my life's more hurt than comfort, <br />
        the tides are coming, and the waves, they have washed me <br />
        I'm scared of drowning, but this whirlpool is so cunning, <br />
        it lured me in it, I can't get out, no help, I'm sinking <br />
        The last thing I see, the old me, I miss him.
