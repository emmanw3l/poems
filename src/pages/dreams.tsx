        <p>
        I no longer sleep nowadays, <br />
Cause I have no more dreams left to chase, <br />
It's not because I achieved them all, <br />
But because I've given up.

        </p>
        <p>
        My dreams now feel unrealistic, <br />
What once felt achievable now feels like a joke, <br />
I've gotten my energy drained out of me, <br />
And I'm struggling to see a reason to live, <br />
To be as competitive as I was before, <br />
To strive to achieve like never before.

        </p>
        <p>
        Instead here I am, a sobbing mess, <br />
All my dreams are now nightmares, <br />
All my joy has washed away, <br />
The residue is nothing but pain.

        </p>
        <p>
        The dreams I dreamt were lies I told myself, <br />
I'm free from the lies, and that's why I have nightmares, <br />
Cause life without hope is a dreary existence, <br />
To live and not dream is a hellish experience.

        </p>
        <p>
        Dreams give birth to hope, <br />
And hope inspires you to do more, <br />
But without hope to keep you going and striving for more, <br />
And no dreams to chase to become something more, <br />
You become a regular old Joe, <br />
Existing until you don't.

        </p>
        <p>
        Dreams are a gateway to the soul, <br />
They push us out of our comfort zone, <br />
To strive for what we want to achieve, <br />
And make us feel anything is within our reach, <br />
But I have no more dreams left in me, <br />
No hopes to ever become anything, <br />
It hurts to say, but the truth prevails, <br />
The regular old Joe is me.
