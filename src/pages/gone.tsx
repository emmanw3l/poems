            <p>
            My days of happiness have been brought to an abrupt end <br />
I was sent to hell with my tails tucked between my legs <br />
The walk of shame nothing compared to the walk I made <br />
Complaints greeting me before I reached the gate <br />
O what a price to pay for my happy days <br />
Joy for five days then frustration begins <br />
Joy for five days to taste freedom and leave <br />
Gone for five days, no one disturbed me <br />
Now I'm back, I must say, this place ain't healthy <br />
It's sad to say, but no one cares about me
