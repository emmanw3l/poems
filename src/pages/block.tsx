            Writing nowadays is slowly becoming a chore, <br />
As I watch creativity seep away through my pores, <br />
They escape, evaporating through my cell’s membranes, <br />
Creating a haze of inspiration a hair’s breadth away, <br />
All around me trying to cling to my skin, <br />
But becomes an impermeable barrier whenever I reach for it, <br />
Inspiration at the tip of my fingers, <br />
But creativity refuses to linger, <br />
In a pseudo state of enlightenment, <br />
Forced to discard so many ideas, <br />
All I have is what I want the finished work to be, <br />
But writing it down becomes another thing, <br />
Why do I genuinely even bother? <br />
My river of inspiration has all but dried up, <br />
And no matter how many times I put my pen to paper, <br />
The drought in my mind never falters, <br />
I’m stuck in a perpetual state of unfinished ideas, <br />
The concepts are right there, I just need to find the right words
