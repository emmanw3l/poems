        Reality and illusion are interwoven to form something that isn't <br />a
        smile could have a thousand meanings, depends on how you perceive it{" "}
        <br />
        a laugh could feel so hollow if the intent of it is misleading <br />
        what's meant to signify joy and mirth becomes a tool for deceit
      </p>
      <p>
        We smile to cover up our pain and hope that it'll go away <br />
        We laugh when things aren't going our way <br />
        A ruse we use to keep pain at bay <br />
        A smile a laugh, two worlds one half <br />
        And on the opposite side a frown a cry <br />
        Are they really that different from each other <br />
        When they suppress emotions that fuel our need to be better
      </p>
      <p>
        Life and death are on opposite sides, but they really aren't so
        different <br />
        to live is to prepare to die, it's inexplicably interwoven
      </p>
      <p>
        Death comes after life but the reverse is also a case <br />
        cause death gives birth to a new life their fates are intertwined
      </p>
      <p>
        Death is the end of something and life is the beginning <br />
        But death could be the birth of something to give life a new meaning
      </p>
      <p>
        To cut off an aspect of yourself is to leave that aspect of you for dead{" "}
        <br />
        But to learn from your mistakes is a lease on life that should by all
        means be dead
      </p>
      <p>
        So is life really the beginning and is death truly the end <br />
        Or is it an endless cycle of death and a rebirth❓
      </p>
      <p>
        To be or not to be could be the question of the century <br />
        I am but I am not, confusion might just be the enemy <br />
        indecision leads to hesitance which might just lead to doubt <br />
        the questioning of everything, the with or the without <br />
        the death of an idea can in turn bring new one to life <br />
        so is doubt really the enemy if it helps us see the light ❓
      </p>
      <p>
        But some things aren't black or white and can't simply be defined <br />
        The human mind is as complex as anything you'd ever find <br />
        Every decision we take or make leads to different paths <br />
        You can do something with bad intentions and you get blamed for that
      </p>
      <p>Or do something with good intentions and still get flamed for that</p>
      <p>
        So are our choices good or evil <br />
        Are they black or white <br />
        Do they meet up in the middle or are they miles apart <br />
        Is the world just different shades of grey <br />
        No absolute wrongs or rights <br />
        Everyone's an artist with the same colour palette <br />
        It's all just black and white
      </p>
      <p>
      Doubt has lead to so many things, but also stopped a lot <br />
has brought about self-realization and also led to morgues <br />
it's something we simply cannot scale but still dwells in our minds <br />
The certainty that nothing's sure <br />
The understanding of none
      </p>
      <p>
      Conviction on the other hand, the opposite of doubt <br />
where one is to question oneself and the other you're sure about <br />
to be convinced you're on the right path, your resolve must be profound <br />
All it takes is a little doubt to unravel all your plans <br />
two sides of the same coin, to be with one is to lack the other <br />
But is this really true and they can't coexist together ❓
      </p>
      <p>
      To seek the truth is to doubt that what you have is all there is to find <br />
Conviction is the finality that what you have is all there is to find <br />
But without the full picture, you can be convinced and still be in doubt <br />
And even with the full picture, you can be convinced and still be in doubt
      </p>
      <p>
      So to answer the earlier question <br />
They can, but then they also can't <br />
You can be with one and still have the other <br />
Not everything can be black or white <br />
We live in a world that's full of grey <br />
The blacks and whites all mix the same <br />
And at the end of the day, all that we're left with is grey <br />
So many different shades of grey
