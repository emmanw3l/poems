      <p>
        They say she always comes right around and bites <br />
        I guess I must have done bad for her to bite me twice <br />
        Once beaten, twice shy <br />
        That’s how I felt <br />
        For her to strike back twice, a heavy blow was dealt <br />
        I’m on karma’s radar and I’m not impressed <br />
        She’s hunting me down and now I feel depressed <br />
        I did nothing wrong, and I’m still being pressed <br />
        The universe is alive and it wants me dead
      </p>
      <p>
        If I knew who I wronged, I’d make things right <br />
        I don’t want to suffer and live a stress filled life <br />
        Karma always comes around <br />
        But never does if you’ve done no harm <br />
        I’m scared to die <br />
        But I’m scared to death <br />
        And with recent events <br />
        I might as well be dead <br />
        Karma is a bitch and she’s out for revenge <br />
        And she won’t let up until I’ve met my end
