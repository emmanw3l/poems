        “One last sunset before I go” <br />
        I said trying to prolong the inevitable even though it was pointless,{" "}
        <br />
        My assailant never said a word but continued their relentless approach
        towards me, <br />
        Leaving me a throbbing mess, <br />
        I could try to run again but what good would it be, <br />
        Sooner or later we’d be back here again, <br />
        Where it all started.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m tired of running, <br />
        I’m tired of watching over my shoulder for when they’d be coming, <br />
        I’m tired of watching everything crumble all around me leaving me with
        nothing, <br />
        I’m tired of starting families only to watch them all die leaving me
        feeling empty.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve lived a long and fulfilled life, <br />
        One filled with hope and despair, <br />
        Filled with sorrows and joy, <br />
        Filled with peace and hurt, <br />
        Filled with everything I could ever want and more, <br />
        But it never filled the void in my heart, <br />
        Knowing one day it’ll all go away, <br />
        That I’d live all my life watching over my shoulder for my silent
        assailer to come and tell me “It’s over” <br />
        No, it never filled that void, <br />
        It never healed my paranoia or healed my hurt, <br />
        It never closed the wound that came from the families I’ve lost, <br />
        Never made me sleep well at night, always making me keep watch, <br />
        I never realised how much it could hurt till I lost too many people to
        keep track of them all, <br />
        Now I just want to end it so I can finally have a moment of peace if
        only for a brief second.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve lived hundreds of years, the term time has lost it’s meaning,{" "}
        <br />
        I’ve been to practically everywhere and seen what life has got to give
        me, <br />
        I’ve seen the cruelty of man, the gift that just keeps on giving, <br />
        I’ve seen the darkest of men to whom light is but a mystery, <br />
        I’ve seen and done so much, it’s in unquantifiable words, <br />
        I’ve also lost so much I can’t fathom it all at all, <br />
        I’m tired of everything I’ve seen, all the fake lives I’ve lived, <br />
        I’m so tired I stayed rooted to this spot waiting till I cease to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turns out I didn’t have to wait for long, <br />
        My assailant was already at my door, <br />
        So I walked out to the balcony to see the sunset once more, <br />
        “One last sunset before I go” <br />
        I said to the snail by the window, <br />
        But did nothing to stop it when it kept on crawling towards me, <br />
        I’ve been running for far too long, <br />
        And I’m tired of all the fuss, <br />
        I’ve lived a pretty long life but we all have to die.
