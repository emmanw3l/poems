      <p>
        I've come to accept that not everyone receives love, and it's cool{" "}
        <br />
        Love isn't something that can just be received willy-nilly <br />
        Love is a sign that someone cares about you, and not everyone can boast
        of that, <br />
        Certainly not me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not me in the sense that I feel I’m undeserving of it or that it’s a
        foreign concept to me, <br />
        Not me in the sense that I don’t think I’m worth it, <br />
        But rather, I feel like it’d be wasted on me, <br />
        Why love someone who isn’t even comfortable in their own skin?
      </p>
      <p>
        And while I wouldn't go as far as saying I've never been loved in my
        life, Romantic love is something that always seems out of reach <br />
        And as much as it pains me to have to admit it, <br />
        Unfortunately, that's just the way it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing has ever seemed out of reach the way love is to me, <br />
        It’s gotten to the point I don’t even crush on anyone anymore cause I
        know I wouldn’t act on it, <br />
        Admiring from a distance is cool but that’s only the half of it, <br />
        The other half is when I kill the zeal to approach a lady because I
        can’t commit. <br />
        Can’t commit in the sense I don’t know how to act romantically and if I
        were to ever date, I wouldn’t start acting differently, <br />
        Unfortunately, this is seen as a turn off for most cause what’s the
        proof that the love is real.
      </p>
      <p>
        No need searching for love where you won't find it, that's a beautiful
        way to get your heart broken. <br />
        No need to force love where it won't happen, that's a waste of energy
        and a drain in your soul. <br />
        No need looking for love in all of the wrong places, makes it feel like
        you’re starved for attention. <br />
        No need trying your hand at loving me romantically, that’s just an awful
        way to let your time go. <br />
        For love is a fickle thing and I wouldn't want anybody to waste theirs
        on me, <br />
        but we don't get to choose who loves us especially if it’s
        unconditionally.
