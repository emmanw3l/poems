      <p>
        In the loneliest hour of my pitiful life <br />
        depressing thoughts are a recurring fright <br />
        the voice in my head that says that I should die, <br />
        increases it’s tempo and I just might try
      </p>
      <p>
        I can't seem to fathom how I got my life <br />
        If I could see my future, I'd gouge my eyes <br />
        The present is already overbearing, <br />
        I’d rather the future remain uncertain,
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t a life, this is torture and at times I cry <br />I need
        someone who'd at least be by my side
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not living, I'm just waking up to sleep <br />
        that's all there is, there's no in-between <br />
        get up and eat, think, think, think then sleep <br />
        rinse, repeat, the cycle is incomplete
      </p>
      <p>
        No room for more, there's only room for one and I'm not the one, <br />
        I'm just an empty hull <br />
        because I keep thinking depressing thoughts <br />
        if only I could stop how my brain works <br />
        but I can't, so I am just swept along <br />
        the person you see, isn't really here, I'm gone
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not even in one piece <br />
        At war with peace <br />
        that's why I'd win,
        <br />
        conflict?
        <br />
        it's all in me <br />
        I'm disgusting,
        <br />
        my mind, it traps me <br />
        I can think, but not coherently <br />
        I'm crumbling, the darkness is eating me
      </p>
      <p>
        That's when I feel a slight humidity <br />
        On my skin it prickles me <br />
        The pitter-patter of it's beat <br />
        Echoes around me and I'm on my feet <br />
        Moving as fast as it'll take me <br />
        To the source of joy that always unburdens me <br />
        And now I'm free, but it's momentarily <br />
        Cause eventually, it'll stop it's therapy <br />
        And I'd cry in vain and sob and wait in pain, for the day it'll come and
        not go away
