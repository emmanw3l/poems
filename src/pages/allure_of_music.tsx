        It’s become hardwired into my daily activities, <br />
        I wonder if I’ve become overdependent on it, <br />
        I can barely go a day without indulging in it, <br />
        Early signs of addiction is what I’m beginning to exhibit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every morning as soon as I wake up that’s the first thing I do, <br />
        Before I start my day or even get to clean my room, <br />
        I take a little bit of it as I prepare to face my day, <br />
        Without it I fear I may not make it through the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        To say I’m addicted would be an oversimplification of things, <br />
        But to say I overindulge would be a gross misunderstanding, <br />
        In a way it’s more like a clutch to me, <br />
        To cling unto my last slivers of sanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I fear if I don’t partake in it I may go crazy, <br />
        So I shut the world out instead of embrace my fears, <br />
        My thoughts are too loud and I’m scared of what I might come up with,{" "}
        <br />
        So I distract my mind by drinking from the tainted well, <br />
        A well that I’ve grown accustomed to, <br />
        The addictive whispers I have succumbed to, <br />
        Forever present in every aspect of my day, <br />
        Running in the background to stave the bad thoughts away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using one evil to quell the other, <br />
        Delaying the inevitable trying to instil some order, <br />
        All that does is fetter me to one and giving me the façade I’ve bested
        the other, <br />
        But the moment I let my guard down, all that work becomes redundant.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m kidding myself if I think I can ensconce myself from the plights of
        the world, <br />
        And keep my mind shut while I drown in the songs, <br />
        Eventually it’d all run out, <br />
        And I’d be forced to face the truth I’ve been avoiding for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
      Music can’t save me, it’s nothing but a stopgap, <br />
One that would soon be overpowered by the mountain it’s been pushing back, <br />
I hide behind it’s covers but even those are not everlasting, <br />
Listening to songs cause I can’t bear to face the music.
      </p>
      <p>
      It's not even a tainted well, an addiction or an evil to quell, <br />
But my overdependence on it has twisted it’s meaning and now it’s hard to tell, <br />
I took something good and used it to shut out the world, <br />
Cause I couldn’t bear to see the truth as it was, <br />
But now what happens when I can no longer go down that road, <br />
The clutch I’ve come to depend on showing me what I’ve been trying to avoid, <br />
What happens when it can no longer stave the thoughts and let them run amok, <br />
What happens when it runs out and emotions that have been buried come alive?
