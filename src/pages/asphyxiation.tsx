        It was slowly getting harder to breathe <br />
        The smoke was all around me, I couldn’t even see <br />
        My lungs were failing me and my chest felt heavy <br />
        To tell the truth, I didn’t have much long to live
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to get up, but my feet were stuck <br />
        I tried everything but I couldn’t even budge <br />I could tell some
        bones were broken even though I only felt numb
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to scream for help, but the roar of the flames were louder{" "}
        <br />
        And if anyone did her me, I’m sure they wouldn’t even bother in the
        innermost part of a house that was on fire, <br />
        My life was slowly draining, my vision getting blurrier <br />I could
        see the grim reaper just waiting for me to slumber
      </p>
      <p>
        So I took a deep breath and regretted right after <br />
        The smoke was unbearable as the fire grew hotter <br />
        Many a time, I almost passed out <br />
        But on the brink of death, I always heard laughter <br />
        And it made me angrier that someone was watching but couldn’t do
        anything except to mock me
      </p>
      <p>
        It may have been in my head, but it kept me alive <br />
        The shame of death seemed to give me new life <br />
        But the life was meaningless for as long as I was trapped with two limbs
        under, I couldn’t move out
      </p>
      <p>
        The fire had reached me, surely I was gone now <br />
        I tried so hard to leave but I was let down <br />
        Quite literally, I was being pinned down <br />
        I knew if I died, I was surely hellbound <br />
        And that saddened me, <br />
        The fact it would all end now <br />
        An unaccomplished life up in flames I’m going to hell now <br />
        Is this how my story ends, has all the ink ran out <br />
        Or is there time for one more twist before I lay down
      </p>
      <p>
        With this thought in my head, I refused to die now <br />
        A surge of energy refueled my dying arms <br />
        And with herculean effort I pulled my legs out
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the pain hit me <br />
        The blood loss I had been incurring <br />
        Had gone on for too long, I needed a surgery <br />
        I started to crawl out, the smoke was heavy <br />
        And I didn’t have a mask, I was left feeling dizzy
      </p>
      <p>
        My legs were mangled and the floor was hot <br />
        I refused to give in, I wouldn’t come up short <br />
        My head was spinning, I was not sure I could make it <br />
        I had crawled for so long, you could mistake me for a baby,
        <br />
        But the pain was so much, I was slowly drifting <br />
        At least I had died fighting, and not under some debris
      </p>
      <p>
        All of a sudden, right before I was about to give in <br />
        I heard a crashing noise, and I thought the building caved in but I was
        wrong, it was the door that went flying <br />
        And some firemen came in and started fighting <br />
        At least that was what I saw right before I passed out
      </p>
      <p>
        And I thought I was dead when I saw a bright light <br />
        Then I heard a beeping and realized that I was alive <br />
        On a hospital bed, I thank the lord I didn’t die out <br />
        Like the fire that spread all over my right arm
