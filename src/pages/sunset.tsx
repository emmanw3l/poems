        We both knew our time together was coming to an end, <br />
        We weren't blind to all the signs that were there, <br />
        Compatibility had dropped to an all-time low <br />
        It wasn't long before we'd be forced to let go.
      </p>
      <p>
        So it was with a heavy heart that I invited her to the beach <br />
        The waves of water lapping beneath our feet <br />
        The sand all around us, so distant yet so near <br />
        In our protective bubble, we couldn't care for anything else
      </p>
      <p>
        We watched the sun as it slowly set <br />
        In our hearts, we knew this would be the end <br />
        The golden rays bathed us in it's warm glow <br />
        And the sun was quickly reaching the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
        By my side, I saw her looking towards me, <br />
        And I gathered the courage to say what we were both thinking <br />
        Even as I saw a tear fall from her eye <br />
        I had to resist the urge to also not cry <br />
        With every passing second, my resolve waivered <br />
        was this what we really wanted, <br />
        was there no way forward? <br />
        Turning back towards the horizon, a hint of sadness in my voice <br />
        As I said the words that would end it all, <br />
        signalling the end of a year-long run.
