        Sometimes, difficulty doesn’t come from making the tough decisions, but
        rather from living with the consequences of your actions. <br />
        Sacrifices without a hint of doubt are nothing but decisions we parade
        as difficult to ease our minds, a true sacrifice is one done with the
        express knowledge of loss and an awareness that what we lose may be gone
        forever. <br />
        What is a sacrifice if it doesn’t hurt, but what good is the pain if the
        sacrifice was for naught? <br />
        Why risk your wellbeing for someone who’d turn around and stab you in
        the back, someone unwilling to make those sacrifices together, someone
        whose only attraction is to themselves as they see you as a mere blip on
        their radar, why sacrifice anything for them only to get doubly hurt.
      </p>
      <p>
        What good is the pain if it leaves an uncoverable scar, one that affects
        your future relations and existing ones, that make you doubt everyone
        because you gave your all to someone that broke you.

        What’s the point in having a partner that always mistreats you, a
        partner that sees you as a subordinate to be used and abused never once
        treating you like an equal. It takes two to tango, but when half the
        party feels inferior to the other half, it becomes a dance of attrition,
        a dance that cannot be likened to sacrifice cause a sacrifice is done
        with a goal in mind and if the goal is a change in character simply
        because of obeisance, it’s no longer sacrifice and now becomes torture.

        Learning when to let go is a skill we take for granted, sometimes the
        best person to change someone isn’t always you and sometimes the best
        person to be in a situation isn’t always you, and that’s why sacrifices
        hurt. To give something up to see someone you love happy, even if the
        happiness is without you.

        Sometimes difficulty doesn’t come from making tough decisions but from
        living in the aftermath of our choices
