        Reality and illusion are interwoven to form something that isn’t <br />
        A smile could have a thousand meanings, depends on how you perceive it{" "}
        <br />
        A laugh could feel so hollow if the intent of it is misleading <br />
        What’s meant to signify joy and mirth becomes a tool for deceit
      </p>
      <p>
        Life and death are on opposite sides, but they really aren’t so
        different <br />
        To live is to prepare to die, it’s inexplicably interwoven
      </p>
      <p>
        Death comes after life but the reverse is also a case <br />
        Cause death gives birth to a new life their fates are intertwined
      </p>
      <p>
        To be or not to be could be the question of the century <br />
        I am but I am not, confusion might just be the enemy <br />
        Indecision leads to hesitance which might just lead to doubt <br />
        The questioning of everything, the with or the without <br />
        The death of an idea can in turn bring new one to life <br />
        So is doubt really the enemy if it helps us see the light
      </p>
      <p>
        But somethings aren’t black or white and can’t simply be defined <br />
        Doubt has lead to so many things, but also stopped a lot <br />
        Has brought about self realization and also led to morgues <br />
        It’s something we simply cannot scale but still dwells in our minds
      </p>
      <p>
        Conviction on the other hand, the opposite of doubt <br />
        Where one is to question oneself and the other you’re sure about <br />
        To be convinced you’re on the right path, your resolve must be profound{" "}
        <br />
        All it takes is a little doubt to unravel all your plans <br />
        Two sides of the same coin, to be with one is to lack the other <br />
        They’re irrevocably bound together <br />
        Not convinced.... well you’re in doubt
