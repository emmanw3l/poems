        I wonder what it feels like to have a hobby, <br />
        Something to look forward to doing, <br />
        Something to keep me excited or to finally engage in an activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder what it feels like to have passion, <br />
        To love something so much, I show it through my actions, <br />
        To share it with any and everybody to gauge their reactions, <br />
        And get disappointed whenever they show dispassion.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder what it feels like to feel sadness, <br />
        To feel like I’m all alone in the universe, in an abyss of darkness,{" "}
        <br />
        To feel like no one cares about me and cry about it, <br />
        To feel a raging emptiness inside, to be unhappy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder what it feels like to feel fear, <br />
        To feel a deep shiver in my soul, to be scared, <br />
        A fright to which nothing else can be compared, <br />
        Scared frozen cause of an emotion too overwhelming to bear.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder what it feels like to show compassion, <br />
        To feel everything around me, be in tune with my emotions, <br />
        Treat everyone around me equally, we’re all humans after all, <br />
        Love someone unconditionally, come rain come sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder what it feels like to be happy, <br />
        To be so full of joy it bleeds into my surroundings, <br />
        To be so elated, I start feeling euphoric, <br />
        To be so high on life that I’m free from all my burdens.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder what it feels like to be angry, <br />
        To be so full of rage that red is all I can see, <br />
        To be so controlled by my emotions that my fury begins seething, <br />
        And anything I think of at the moment is filled with hostility.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder what it feels like to feel love, <br />
        To prioritise someone so much that to an outsider, I look dumb, <br />
        To be happy whenever they’re around cause their presence incites joy,{" "}
        <br />
        To know that no matter what happens, to someone out there, I’m genuinely
        loved.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder what it feels like to feel anything at all, <br />
        To not be so emotionally detached, have things I care for, <br />
        To not have to explain everytime why I do not smile more, <br />
        To not have to keep a façade every time I walk through a door, <br />
        To react to anything with a smile or a dejected look, <br />
        Not the impervious look people around me has grown accustomed to, <br />
        To not have to struggle to show signs of humanity, <br />
        To add some ink to my bleak reality.
