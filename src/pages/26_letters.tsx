      <p>
        A is for all the times I put up with your shit, hoping we would work
        even though you were a cheat.
      </p>
      <p>
        B is for bed times when I stayed up and cried, wondering why you'd ever
        do this to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        C is for all the times I called you, you never picked up but simply let
        it ring.
      </p>
      <p>
        D is for days where I wondered if we were real, was it really love or
        was I just your play thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        E is for everything I ever did, that you never reciprocated, it was all
        a one-way trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        F is for everything that was ever your fault, that you pinned on me,
        making me take the fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        G is for the good things I thought you did, turns out they were to lure
        me, to keep me from leaving.
      </p>
      <p>
        H is for Hector, the ex that wasn't really an ex, amd when we were
        together, the bane of my existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        I is for indecision, I'd never forgive myself for waiting, I should have
        left you long ago, but I kept on hesitating.
      </p>
      <p>
        J is for justice, not that I ever had it cause you were so unjustly,{" "}
        <br />
        But the irony I could have had it, had I left from the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        K is for kisses we shared, turns out they were lies from the depths of
        hell.
      </p>
      <p>
        L is for all the lies you told, why I ever fell for them, I guess I'd
        never know.
      </p>
      <p>
        M is for money I spent, that's not even the worst part, but you still
        left me in debt.
      </p>
      <p>
        N is for negative vibes, I should have known you weren't down for a
        ride.
      </p>
      <p>
        O is for us being over, you never loved me and now it's öga för öga.
      </p>
      <p>
        P is for you being phlegmatic, incredibly boring to talk to, simply
        unexciting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q is for leaving my feelings in a quagmire, jumbled up and mushed
        together, can't make heads or tails of what transpired.
      </p>
      <p>
        R is for realisation that you never really loved me and the beginning of
        our breakup, or me letting you be.
      </p>
      <p>
        S is for sacrifices I made, I was too love struck and wasn't thinking
        straight.
      </p>
      <p>
        T is for your transgressions, I used to ignore them, but not anymore.
        You lack accountability, always looking for who to throw under the bus,
        can't man up to your own actions, so prepare to be in a world of hurt.
      </p>
      <p>
        U is for unnecessary proclamations, you never replied to them, so why
        did I feed your ego?
      </p>
      <p>
        V is for vocations, you never had any but always wanted remuneration.
      </p>
      <p>
        W is for wedges that I drove between us before I called it quits, <br />
        You didn't even notice and that stung quite a bit, but I didn't let it
        hurt me cause you don't deserve it.
      </p>
      <p>
        X is for all the X's you ticked, a walking red flag that my love refused
        to see, they say love is blind and now I see why, cause despite all your
        flags, i turned a blind eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        Y is for yapping, cause that's what you claimed I always did, of course
        you'd see it as yapping, considering you never said anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Z is for Ziploc, if only I could stuff you in one. Quarantine you from
        the rest of the world, make you feel devoid of love.
      </p>
