        Mirror mirror on the wall, who do you see when I look in your world?{" "}
        <br />
        Do you see the best version of myself or do you see someone really
        trying their best, <br />
        Do you see me as a façade, and my real self tightly grasped in your
        hands, <br />
        Simply existing from day to day, doing their best to keep the bad vibes
        at bay, <br />
        And yet, no matter how hard they try, the stress of it all still shows
        in their eyes?
      </p>
      <p>
        Mirror mirror on the wall, you’re the only one with whom I can talk,{" "}
        <br />
        When I look at you I see a scared person, but then I look deeper and see
        who I want to be, <br />
        Buried under a pile of insecurities, chained down by my own lack of
        self-belief, <br />
        Looking at me distraught at who we turned out to be, staring back at me
        disappointingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mirror mirror on the wall, I don’t know who I am anymore, <br />
        As I gaze in your world and stare at myself, I don’t recognise the
        person that stares back at me, <br />
        As I look into my eyes that hold no emotion, I see a soul, a soul that’s
        been broken, <br />
        Discarded and abandoned, beaten and bruised, left for dead at an early
        age, gone too soon, <br />
        Abandoned with their hopes and dreams, aspirations and self-belief,{" "}
        <br />
        And I shed a tear at who I’ve become a shell of myself, a walking
        corpse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mirror mirror on the wall, sometimes I cry, sometimes I mourn, <br />
        What has life got in store for me, nothing but atrocities, <br />
        From one curveball to the next, trials upon trials with no rest, <br />
        I’m ashamed to say that they got me down and I can’t muster the strength
        to get up one more time, <br />
        So I lay there wallowing in self-pity, sometimes I cry, but most times I
        mourn, <br />
        At the death of the person who I was supposed to be, buried under a pile
        of my own self-esteem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mirror mirror on the wall, who do you see when I look in your world,{" "}
        <br />
        Do you see someone who’s given it their all, or someone whose potential
        remains untouched, <br />
        Do you see someone at the verge of having it all or someone forever
        destined to be in a rut, <br />
        Do you still see hope in my eyes, or has my despair rendered you blind,{" "}
        <br />
        Or do you see me as a reflection of all your bad decisions?
      </p>
      <p>
        Mirror mirror on the wall, the truth is I can struggle no more, <br />
        I don’t want the tough times or atrocities, I just want good, is that
        too much for me? <br />
        I’m tired of living like I was born to fight, fighting for my life every
        day I’m alive, <br />
        I just want to live, happy and free, free from all of my misery, <br />
        So I can finally stop my self-loathing and learn what it feels like to
        love me.
