      <p>
        What goes around come around <br />
        But for once, can't a boomerang be in the lost and found <br />
        Cross my heart and hope to die <br />
        But still I lead a wanton life <br />
        Blood and hatred, drugs and crime <br />
        I’ve seen my fair share, I’ve done the time <br />
        But I can’t seem to escape my baggage <br />
        Free as a bird but burdened down <br />
        Is this a reward of my actions, <br />
        The dirty days and bloody nights <br />
        Countless crimes of endless nights <br />
        The baggage too heavy to handle <br />
        The trauma, a dam full <br />
        I guess the boomerang did come back around <br />
        Faster than I threw it the first time around <br />
        Actions have consequences, I’ve got that pat down <br />
        I just wish my consequences weren’t based off a life of crime
