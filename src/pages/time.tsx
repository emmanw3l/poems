      <p>
        What if we’re all just puppets in the hands of time <br />
        To be used and disposed like we don’t have lives <br />
        The concept we’ve been trying so hard to grasp <br />
        Is a fickle thing and it might just blow up our minds <br />
        Time is constant and ever changing <br />
        And so is everything that’s within it <br />
        But we are not constant, for time always takes us <br />
        But if it’s infinite, then why can’t we be <br />
        We work and we slave just to grow up and die <br />
        The time that we spent are a part of our lives <br />
        We don’t spend our time, we spend part of our lives <br />
        There’s no rewind in real life, make every moment count <br />
        Time is universal and personal for all <br />
        We’re bound by it’s laws and we’re bound by it’s claws <br />
        Some get better with age <br />
        But we all deteriorate <br />
        Time is a hard master and we’re nothing but slaves
