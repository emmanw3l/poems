      <p>
        This question has been bothering me for days on end <br />
        But I have no one else to talk to besides myself <br />
        So I pick up a pen and paper and write away <br />
        Pretending to receive a letter from my literal self
      </p>
      <p>
        All for one and one for all <br />
        That was our saying till we fell in a rut <br />
        Who's to say where we went wrong <br />
        But the vibes just weren't there anymore
      </p>
      <p>
        An eye for an eye was how things were done <br />
        So we backstabbed each other and said there was nothing wrong <br />
        Slowly drifting apart like we're on different boats <br />
        Splintering apart, we were on different routes
      </p>
      <p>
        Did we try to make it work <br />
        Or did we further spoil the broth <br />
        Too many cooks, <br />
        It's no wonder that our story didn't work
      </p>
      <p>
        I still can't fathom how it didn't <br />
        Whatever went wrong, why couldn't I I see it <br />
        We all just went our separate ways <br />
        Severed ties and went astray
      </p>
      <p>
        We were a clique, a group, a troupe <br />
        Someone snapped a finger and we were down to two <br />
        Like a magic trick borne out of the blue <br />
        They left with nary a clue
      </p>
      <p>
        And I admit it was fun for a while <br />
        Two halves of a whole, we were doing just fine <br />
        Till I got the news that broke me, <br />
        My other half was leaving the country
      </p>
      <p>
        We kept in touch for a while <br />
        But the distance killed the vibes <br />
        I lost everyone I called a friend <br />
        Left alone to fend for myself
      </p>
      <p>
        And as antisocial as I was <br />
        I couldn't talk to anyone <br />
        Watched others laugh in joy <br />
        While I sat in my corner and sobbed
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I thought to myself; <br />
        Who needs new friends, <br />
        All they ever do is leave in the end <br />
        I've lost some of my best, <br />
        And I can't stomach the pain <br />
        So I'd make sure my next never leave like the rest
      </p>
      <p>
        I got a lot of side eyes and more people avoided me <br />
        Maybe talking to alter egos shouldn't be done publicly <br />
        But if I'm ashamed of my friends and o lying talk to them in private{" "}
        <br />
        Are they really friends or just a means to an end
      </p>
      <p>
        But at the end of the day, it's really only me <br />
        And my "friends" all live in my head rent free <br />
        So now my question pops up now that you've gotten the backstory <br />
        Is it really a circle of friends, when it's just you and yourself?
