      <p>
        Pretence is a tool we use to hide the truth, <br />
        We'd rather hear lies than face the truth, <br />
        So we make facades that we convince ourselves are true, <br />
        Even though we know deep down it is a ruse.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be happy, one must live through the pain, <br />
        And come out stronger at the end of the day, <br />
        But what if I chose to ignore it <br />
        And suppress the pain like the rest of my emotions?
      </p>
      <p>
        why would I ever entertain bad news <br />
        When I can just pretend it doesn't exist? <br />
        What's the point of having an imagination <br />
        When you never get to use it in times like this?
      </p>
      <p>
        Did you say something sad? <br />
        I'd pretend I didn't hear it. <br />
        Do I know something bad? <br />
        I'd pretend I'm ignorant. <br />
        Do I like travelling? <br />
        I'd pretend I'm an itinerant. <br />
        Do I need to be aggressive? <br />
        I'd pretend I'm belligerent. <br />
        Did what you said hurt me? <br />
        I'd pretend I'm indifferent. <br />
        Did I hear myself being laughed at? <br />
        I'd pretend I'm an illiterate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why cry when you can laugh? <br />
        no matter how fake, <br />
        Better glad than sad. <br />
        Does it matter if it's a facade? <br />
        Fake it till you make it, <br />
        It can't be that hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know I see the world through a glass, <br />
        That's been stained by my self-doubt, <br />
        Warping reality to fit me, <br />
        cause I can't bear to face what's real. <br />
        I'm scared of what I'd find, so I shut my eyes and pretend I'm blind
