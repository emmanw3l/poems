      <p>walking down the road in the middle of the night</p>
      <p>praying to God that I do breathe my last</p>
      <p>and the fucked up part is that I can't turn back now</p>
      <p>I'm walking down the road hoping that I see a light</p>
      <p>
        my life's the darkest shade of black, so any light will do just fine
      </p>
      <p>if it's a headlight, even better, best to end it here and now</p>
      <p>than to live in total misery for the rest years of my life</p>
      <p>
        keep on walking down the highway reminiscing about the times; <br />{" "}
        that didn't happen, I'm daydreaming, wishing my life was a lie
      </p>
      <p>that I'd wake up in a bed, I've been in a coma the whole time</p>
      <p>
        and then I'd smile and then I'd laugh, conflict eating me inside <br />
        but this is real, the pain I feel is not something that I wanna fight
      </p>
      <p>
      yeah, I'm selfish, stupid, reckless every insult on your mind
      </p>
      <p>
      suicide is not an option but I've gone through all of mine
      </p>
      <p>
      I know I'm helpless, know I'm reckless, there's no saving me this time
      </p>
      <p>
      I don't regret this, need to end this
      </p>
      <p>
      I'd see you in the afterlife.
