        Wish I could be with you <br />
        Hold you tight and pull you close,
        <br />
        Wish I could be everything you wanted <br />
        Or the one you chose
      </p>
      <p>
        I struggled for acceptance <br />
        And hustled to be the best man <br />
        I did everything in my power <br />
        To have you when it’s bedtime
      </p>
      <p>
        Your love I had to earn it <br />
        Your body language, <br />
        I learnt it <br />
        I could do anything you wanted, <br />
        And to this day, won’t regret it
      </p>
      <p>
        At first you shrugged me off <br />
        Said my feelings weren’t just, <br />
        “I only wanted you for your body And nothing more”
      </p>
      <p>
        But I proved my love was real <br />
        We were inseperable like teens and screens <br />
        And I hoped to tie the knot <br />
        To have you forever as my beloved
      </p>
      <p>
        But you left me on this plane <br />
        Shed your mortal coils to run away <br />
        Left me broken and in pain, <br />
        Pain that hurts me till this day
      </p>
      <p>
        You promised we’d be together <br />
        For as long as we loved <br />
        But that didn’t translate to forever <br />
        Our together was short lived
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh how I wish we were immortal <br />
        I’d spend all my time with you <br />
        And I know I’m overbearing <br />
        But I want my forever to be with you
      </p>
