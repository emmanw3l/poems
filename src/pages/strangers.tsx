            <p>
            We started as strangers and ended that way <br />
Sometimes the beginning is the same as the end <br />
What would have been beautiful sadly had to end <br />
We didn’t see eye to eye even though we were friends <br />
Time spent together was an unnecessary debt,  <br />
We just kept on owing each other and piling up regrets <br />
We weren’t even lovers, we were the best of friends  <br />
And I thought I knew you, but we were strangers at the end.

            </p>
            <p>
            Secrets shared were in vain <br />
Truths told were in vain  <br />
I get sad all again <br />
Whenever I hear your name  <br />
I’ve been hurt, still in pain <br />
The cutoff I can’t explain <br />
I tried to be your friend <br />
But my efforts were made in vain

            </p>
            <p>
            We were strangers at the beginning <br />
The same way at the end <br />
A friendship of six years, <br />
Ended through a text

            </p>
            <p>
            Was this my reward for caring <br />
Was this my reward for trying <br />
Was this my reward for keeping you company to stop you from crying

            </p>
            <p>
            It was a one way journey, <br />
You never loved me  <br />
I just wish I knew this  <br />
Before I let you hurt me

            </p>
            <p>
            We started as strangers and ended that way <br />
Sometimes the beginning is the same as the end  <br />
The in-between was nought  <br />
Your feelings weren’t just  <br />
But just know I was the stranger <br />
That you had hurt
