      <p>
        death is the end and life is the beginning <br />
        the journey is long but short for many
      </p>
      <p>
        same destination for one and for all <br />
        a life taken for granted would be worth nought <br />
        the dead stay dead while the living try more <br />
        but the destination is clear, we all leave this world
      </p>
      <p>
        the good die young and the bad also, <br />
        there's no karma at all, just misfortune, <br />
        the sun shines on us all and not a portion, <br />
        life takes from everyone, it's an extortion.
      </p>
      <p>
        life after death is a concept that's foreign <br />
        we all speculate, we all make theories <br />
        but without solid proof, they're all just theories
      </p>
      <p>
        we search for the truth, but don't know where to look <br />
        everyone could be dead, but not all get to choose
      </p>
      <p>
        time is life's worst enemy and death is it's friend <br />
        your time up here is limited, try to go for your best
