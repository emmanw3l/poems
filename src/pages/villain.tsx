            Heroes rise to the occasion and villains fall <br />
That storyline has gone on for too long <br />
Good trumps evil is nothing but wrong <br />
Cause in reality evil trumps all.

            </p>
            <p>
            They say good vs evil is an everlasting war <br />
But the truth of the matter is that evil has won <br />
Hence the saying “The heroes we don’t deserve.” <br />
But evil is ingrained in our blood  <br />
All heroes are undeserved

            </p>
            <p>
            We struggle as a society trying to one-up each other  <br />
Hearts getting blacker by the day as we destroy each other <br />
In the darkest of times at the peak of our existence  <br />
Are we striving for the best or all becoming ingrates <br />
The world needs a saviour in this time of need <br />
And that’s where I feel like I come in 

            </p>
            <p>
            An agent of change in this monotonous world <br />
Sowing good deeds and trust while others sow discord <br />
I’m being targeted for this,  <br />
Nip the problem in the bud <br />
They say good deeds are a virus and they are the cure  <br />
And I am a curse, trying to infect the world  <br />
To shake their “stability” and veer it off-course  <br />
I came with good intentions, yet they’re out for my blood <br />
I may be good, but in their eyes, I’m a villain and more
