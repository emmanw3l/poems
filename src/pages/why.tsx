      How long will it take <br />
      I can no longer wait <br />
      They say healing takes time <br />
      But I gave mine away
    </p>
    <p>
      All the anger and pain <br />
      That I kept till this day <br />
      Have been building inside <br />
      And it won’t go away
    </p>
    <p>
      And I know who to blame <br />
      For all of my mistakes <br />
      Choices made in vain <br />
      Haunt me till this day
    </p>
    <p>
      And I’m somewhat afraid <br />
      Of what I have to say <br />
      But a string of bad choices <br />
      Really does stuff to the brain
    </p>
    <p>
      I know I’m making excuses <br />
      But what else can I make? <br />
      I can’t make decisions <br />
      They all backfire with grace
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I have just one question <br />
      Usually I’d just ask away <br />
      But who do I question? <br />
      If not myself everyday
    </p>
    <p>
      All the pain that you’re brooding <br />
      All the anger you hide <br />
      All the feelings you’ve muted <br />
      And tried to bottle inside
    </p>
    <p>
      What purpose do they achieve? <br />
      What master do they serve? <br />
      If you can’t control your emotions <br />
      Then why do you try?
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ve been let down so many times <br />
      I’m starting to see why you won’t cry <br />
      Cause if your tears hit the ground <br />
      They’d be there for a long time <br />
      So you put on a smile <br />
      And act like you’re alright <br />
      You’re scared to show the real you <br />
      And now I ask,
    </p>
    <p className="text-center bold h3">why?</p>
