      <p>
        This feeling is getting obsessive <br />
        As the heights are no longer impressive <br />
        What started as an occasional session, <br />
        Turned into full blown obsession <br />
        It was a gradual progression <br />
        In tandem with the elevation <br />
        I could feel less and less tension <br />
        But a feeling of elation
      </p>
      <p>
        But I slowly started to lose that <br />
        As I found no more new ground <br />
        No heights to look down from <br />
        And no where to get my high from <br />
        I had been to all the rooftops <br />
        And they no longer gave me comfort <br />
        So I sought out something higher <br />
        That’d give me goosebumps
      </p>
      <p>
        I never considered jumping, <br />
        It’s only the high I need <br />
        But looking down from the tallest building, <br />
        I could tell it won’t satisfy me <br />
        Should I consider skydiving <br />
        Would it give the same feeling <br />
        I need the rush of adrenaline <br />
        That comes when I look down from high peaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I’d consider trying <br />
        Vertigo now eludes me <br />
        The feeling of flying <br />
        May give me what I’m seeking
      </p>
      <p>
        So onto my next mission <br />
        On a plane to seek closure <br />
        I'd jump into my freedom <br />
        This obsession I may never give up
      </p>
