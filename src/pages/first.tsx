      <p>
        Let me try something new <br />
        Nothing weird but actually good <br />
        Think less than I actually should, or maybe even get a girlfriend too{" "}
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Focus, that ain't happening soon <br />
        With your character you'll be forty-two before you realize after all the
        time that flew, all you had to do was turn into a whole new you
      </p>
      <p>
        Nope, mmm mm I'm not gonna self disgrace <br />
        Cause that's how you get into a depressing state <br />
        No, I'm actually going to try to change <br />
        Not my ways, but the way I think these days <br />
        No more rage, all the rage I'll give it away and clean my slate, cause
        I'm tired of all the dreams I get No more hate, I don't really hate per
        se <br />
        But I'll just say, sometimes I really hate somedays <br />
        When I think back to all the mistakes I made and realise that I could
        have done better that day
      </p>
      <p>
        I really hate <br />
        All the times I use to self destruct and not plan my words and say
        whatever the hell I want I really hate, <br />
        All the times I should've stood my ground and not fall down, <br />I
        guess it ain't too late to start
      </p>
      <p>
        I really hate, recalling all the things I hate <br />
        I should probably stop before I start to hate this day <br />
        No more pain, I've gone through enough already <br />
        It may not be many but I need to stop comparing
      </p>
      <p>
        No more regret <br />
        It's gone, that your chance, you missed it <br />
        you should have done more, but you couldn't, you are shy you misfit{" "}
        <br />
        Here I go again with regret, I'm insulting myself <br />
        I need to stop this and not let it control who I am <br />
        I'm bigger than all this, but regret won't make me see crystal clear
      </p>
