It was nice for a minute <br />
Until it became clear  <br />
You were using me from the get go <br />
I was way in over my head  <br />
Thinking that the feelings were mutual  <br />
That the love we shared was real <br />
That the bond we made would never break <br />
We would both be there in need  <br />
Until I found that you’re a cheat <br />
You take and never give <br />
And you only confide in me, when the solution is green <br />
So I slowly began to doubt  <br />
Did the love we had really sprout  <br />
Or was it a budding seed on rocky ground trying to find a way out  <br />
I began to search for clues  <br />
Something to prove I wasn’t being used  <br />
And to my very hurt and utmost shock <br />
I saw you with some dude  <br />
You were kissing and holding hands, running off like newly weds <br />
With a smile on your lips and a skip in your steps <br />
My heart was broken down

            </p>
            <p>
            I wanted to seek for revenge  <br />
But I couldn’t bring myself to cheat back  <br />
So I cried and sobbed and wept and mourned, almost as if I had lost someone <br />
In a way, I guess I did  <br />
I was walking with two left feet <br />
I walked into a relationship with someone that didn’t love me <br /> 
But now I’d dry my tears away  <br />
I feel nothing but regret  <br />
You fooled me once, the shame’s on me  <br />
And I’d never love you again
