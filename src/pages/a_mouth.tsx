      <p>
        Sometimes the brightest smiles hide the darkest secrets, <br />
        A mouth filled with laughter sometimes tells the biggest lies, <br />
        Eyes filled with mirth a dam that holds back the most tears, <br />A
        heart filled with love ends up spewing hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        A smile that signified innocence now represents deceit, <br />A mouth
        that once sang praises now has curses stuck between it’s teeth, <br />
        Eyes that were so full of joy now tells sorrows that transcend beyond
        mere words, <br />A heart that was once kind and pure now pumps
        wickedness through it’s veins.
      </p>
      <p>
        A smile once thought to be happy, a façade to keep the sadness from
        rising, <br />
        A mouth that spread so much joy, tells tales that make the cheerful
        mourn, <br />
        Eyes said to hold so much hope, black holes through which emotions
        croak, <br />A heart once filled with raw emotions, devoid and now
        completely broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        What use is a smile if a lie is all it’d ever tell, <br />
        What good is a mouth when sadness is all it ever spreads, <br />
        What good is an eye if evil is all it’d ever witness, <br />
        What use is a heart emptied of all emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could a smile still be considered one when it’s lost the core of it’s
        being, <br />
        What use is a smile if happiness isn’t what’s being perceived, <br />
        What good is a smile if negative emotions are what it’s portraying,{" "}
        <br />
        What good is a smile when it’s not being made genuinely.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eyes witness horrors beyond what the mouth can tell, <br />
        So much so that it now has a blank stare, <br />
        Scarred by the by things it’s witnessed, broken beyond repair, <br />
        Stares into it’s own reflection, and sees nothing there.
      </p>
      <p>
        A heart filled with pure intentions, a mind that knew no ill-doing,{" "}
        <br />
        Being taken advantage of, the world can be so evil, <br />
        A heart of gold that once shined bright, <br />
        Loses it’s luster, bright lights don’t last, <br />
        what once was enough to light up a stormy night, <br />
        Has been dulled so much it’s now a dying star.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mouth that tells tales off lies and deceit, <br />
        An eye that cries so much, it bleeds, <br />
        A heart shattered, devoid of feelings, <br />A body left incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>
        The smile that once was no longer is, <br />
        A heart that once loved no longer feels, <br />
        The sad truth is that some wounds never heal, <br />
        We just carry the marks and keep on living as is
