            I feel like I’m crazy <br />
If I’m not then why do I hate me <br />
Why do I have such low self esteem <br />
And at every moment, I’m depreciating me 

            </p>
            <p>
            Feel like I’ve not got much to give <br />
And my life is not worth much to live

            </p>
            <p>
            I’ve had lines, but now I’m crossing them <br />
It feels like I contradict myself <br />
I have friends but no one cares <br />
Cause I don’t let them in my head

            </p>
            <p>
            You can’t care if you can’t hear <br />
The thoughts that go up in here <br />
I’m fucking scared of getting help <br />
Cause I don’t know where the problem hems 

            </p>
            <p>
            So who would help if I do share <br />
The wrong info on my mental health

            </p>
            <p>
            I’m confused and helpless <br />
It doesn’t help I help myself less <br />
It doesn’t help that my head’s a mess  <br />
And it doesn’t help  <br />
That I can’t seek help 

            </p>
            <p>
            I’m running mad and running wild  <br />
I should be locked in a mental house  <br />
I’m trapped in my skin  <br />
And my mind isn’t free 

            </p>
            <p>
                I went to visit an asylum, <br />
                They gave me a straitjacket for free....
