            I am loved but heartbroken <br />
I smile through my sorrows <br />
I cry in the open  <br />
 Mask it all as a joke 

            </p>
            <p>
            I am hurt and broken  <br />
My smiles are untruthful <br />
I laugh but not truly  <br />
I’m a mess, that I know

            </p>
            <p>
            I am tired of living <br />
I’m knee deep and sinking  <br />
In the pool of regret  <br />
That came from my river of tears

            </p>
            <p>
            I’m spiralling downwards  <br />
Mentally, I’m a coward  <br />
I run from my problems <br />
That’s why they’re here to stay

            </p>
            <p>
            I lie but I’m truthful <br />
I don’t think I am useful <br />
I hate that I’m a loose screw <br />
What to do, I don’t know

            </p>
            <p>
            I am loved, I am hurt <br />
I am tired, I am cursed  <br />
I’m a coward, a lost cause  <br />
I am in pain, but not for long

            </p>
        </Slate>
