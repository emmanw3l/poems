        As I was walking up the stairs, I saw a man that wasn’t there, <br />
        He wasn’t there yesterday, he wasn’t there again today, <br />
        I walked past him into my parlour even though he wasn’t there, <br />
        I had to squeeze past him on the stairs but it shouldn’t be possible, he
        wasn’t there, <br />
        I sat down on my couch and watched him from the corner of my eye even
        though I knew for a fact that the man, he wasn’t there, <br />
        I didn’t see him move or hear the floor creak but that didn’t put my
        mind at ease, <br />
        Cause the moment I looked away I caught glimpses of the man who I
        could’ve sworn that wasn’t there.

        I woke up with the gnawing feeling of being watched, <br />
        I looked around in my room and as usual, no one was there, <br />
        I got comfortable enough to go back to sleep but as I turned around on
        my bed, <br />
        I saw a man that wasn’t there, <br />
        He wasn’t smiling at me as I screamed at the top of my lungs, <br />
        He didn’t reach his long arms to me in a mock imitation of a hug, <br />
        He wasn’t there this I know, but now I’m not so sure, <br />
        One moment he feels so real but then the next moment he’s gone, <br />
        He wasn’t here right on my bed, he didn’t watch me as I slept, <br />
        He won’t be here again tomorrow, he wasn’t here at all today.
      </p>
      <p>
        I called out into my empty house and got no response, <br />
        And it put my mind at ease cause then I knew no one was here, <br />
        Until I heard my own voice echo back at me <br />
        And what made it all strange was those weren’t the words I said, <br />
        I called out yet again and my own voice answered me but not as an echo
        this time around but rather from behind me, <br />
        I turned around quickly and saw the man that wasn’t there, <br />
        He wasn’t smiling widely at me as I fell right to my knees, <br />
        I looked up from the ground where I was and as usual no one was there,{" "}
        <br />
        No one was here yesterday, no one was here again today.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never met him at the top of the stairs, I never saw him right at my
        bed, <br />
        He was merely a mental image formed from extreme paranoia, <br />
        The fact I’m schizophrenic barely helps, though it does put my mind at
        ease, <br />
        For any discrepancies I find, I chalk it up to me being me, <br />
        It doesn’t matter that I see two sets of footprints leading to my bed,{" "}
        <br />
        The other one isn’t real, <br />
        For the man who wasn’t there wouldn’t be there again.
      </p>

        As I was walking up the stairs, I saw a man that wasn’t there, <br />
        He wasn’t there yesterday, he wasn’t there again today, <br />
        Oh how I wish he’d go away.
