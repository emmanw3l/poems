            <p>
            Perhaps I don't know what to write, and I'm putting pen to paper hoping to bring new thoughts to life. <br />
Perhaps I've hit a road block, one that I can't vault over and the blasted thing just won't budge. <br />
Perhaps my thoughts were for nought, <br />
I've put my pen to paper, <br />
But the words, they won't just come forth. <br />
Perhaps it's not a roadblock, but a blockade on my path as a writer <br />
Must be writer's block.
            </p>
            <p>
            I've stumbled into this block too many times to count <br />
If I took it all and built it up, it could rival China's walls. <br />
My train of thought has many tracks but still I'm lost for words <br />
I just can't seem to fathom my fall from the top.
            </p>
            <p>
            Was a lyrical contortionist, bended words with ease, <br />
Made opposites work together, did as I pleased. <br />
But now I struggle to string a sentence, and my hands they bleed <br />
I put my blood into my craft but still I can't be free. <br />
Free from the blockade that traps me no matter how I struggle. <br />
Free from incoherent thoughts, a mental hurdle. <br />
Free from lack of inspiration, <br />
An observational struggle. <br />
Free from lack of motivation, <br />
Another mental hurdle.
            </p>
            <p>
            Perhaps I should give up writing <br />
What even is the point? <br />
I can't string words together, <br />
Can't do what I love. <br />
Is this the end of a legacy? <br />
One that never took off <br />
Or is this the start of a downfall <br />
Before I got to the top?
            </p>
            <p>
            Turning around and round in circles, <br />
There's no path forward <br />
I'm stuck, chasing my own tail like an ouroboros. <br />
Or a dog, or a fish in a bowl the size of a cup, <br />
All I'm saying's I can't take a step forward, <br />
I'm rooted to a spot.
            </p>
            <p>
            Perhaps this would be the last poem that I ever wrote, <br />
            How ironic that my final poem is on writer's block.
            </p>
            <p>
            Perhaps I'm not as good a writer as I initially thought, <br />
            I'm done trying to escape this hurdle, I think I'd just give up.
