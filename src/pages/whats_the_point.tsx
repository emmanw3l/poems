    <Slate header="WHAT'S THE POINT?">
      <p>
        In a lifelong battle with death only to lose at the end <br />
        Why do I even bother, life isn’t my cross to bear <br />
        What’s the point of the fight if I’d always get knocked out? <br />
        What’s the point of life if death is all I’d find?
      </p>
      <p>
        Is life really worth living if it all ends the same <br />
        No matter what you accomplish, you’ll still end in a grave <br />
        Billions of people, no two lives are ever the same <br />
        Yet the road we strive to pave still leads to a grave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do we even bother running the race <br />
        It’s all a dead end either way <br />
        You can try and try to prolong your life <br />
        But the truth of the matter is we all live to die.
      </p>
      <p>
        So is life really worth living <br />
        If not, isn’t it best to end it early <br />
        Cause why go through all the hurt and shame, <br />
        All the struggles and pain <br />
        All the hate and rage <br />
        To end up a worse person when you get to the grave?
      </p>
      <p>
        Is life worth living if you overstay your welcome, <br />
        What’s the point of it if you’re too fragile to even walk <br />
        Bedridden the rest of your days while others run amok?
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s the point of it when you’ve gotten everything you could ever want{" "}
        <br />
        Does it lose it’s meaning, leaving you feeling numb?
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s the point of it when you’ve fought for so long Delaying the
        inevitable, prolonging your discomfort?
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s the point of it when you have nothing at all <br />
        Struggling to amass something to stop you from being poor <br />
        And even if you got it, does it lose it’s meaning leaving you feeling
        numb? <br />
        Are you happy in that moment, knowing you got everything you could ever
        want <br />
        Or do you keep on working cause that much isn’t enough?
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s the point of it when you’re all alone <br />
        Companionship nowhere to be found, you’re all on your own
        <br />
        Nobody to laugh at your jokes, or listen to your voice or even call your
        phone <br />
        Just you, yourself and loneliness, <br />
        Is that really a life worth fighting for?
