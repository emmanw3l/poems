        How I badly want to fly <br />
        I don’t have wings but I can try <br />
        I want to soar the sky <br />
        And without drugs I want to be high <br />
        Like superman, I’d reach for the skies <br />
        With one hand up, I could if I tried <br />
        But I’m scared of what would happen <br />
        If i did and came crashing down <br />
        So I held on to my fantasy <br />
        And flew only in my dreams <br />
        But those weren’t exhilarating <br />
        I needed much much more <br />
        So I decided that I would risk it <br />
        And steeled my resolve <br />
        Climbed to the top of a building <br />
        Preparing for takeoff <br />
        In a minute I would jump down <br />
        But I won’t go down but up <br />
        Don’t say that I can’t do it <br />
        But instead wish me luck
