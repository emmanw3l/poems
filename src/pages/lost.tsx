            My breath quickened as my head swivelled  <br />
I looked around but could remember little <br />
I was here before, that much was certain <br />
But my memories, my brain was skirting

            </p>
            <p>
            I was trying to act civil,  <br />
But my emotions hit me like a missile <br />
I was struck, my mental state was brittle  <br />
My mazeophobia’s been hunting me since I was little

            </p>
            <p>
            I curled up and screamed till my throat was sore <br />
And if anyone heard me, they didn’t come <br />
I had no idea what I was suffering for <br />
Surely this couldn’t be normal, what did I do wrong

            </p>
            <p>
            Should I not have taken the strange morning bus ? <br />
And fell asleep on it, was that all my fault ? <br />
It’s probably not, but I can’t seem to stop my thoughts <br />
I probably should have gotten off

            </p>
            <p>
            I’m lost and confused, with nowhere to go  <br />
In the middle of nowhere with no sign of a road <br />
I would surely die here, that much was already known <br />
I just wish this was a nightmare and not me waking up in the unknown
