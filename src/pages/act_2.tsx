            <p>
            We're all unpaid actors in this giant set <br />
the play has been on for so long we're gearing up for the end <br />
we facilitate our demise just to meet up with our ends, <br />
controversies everywhere, this may really be the end
            </p>
            <p>
            We were never united, it was all just a front <br />
we were always looking to gain something, no matter the cost <br />
we cheat and steal to put us in front <br />
and claim innocence like we don't know what we'd done
            </p>
            <p>
            We're slowly crumbling and that is a fact <br />
too many opinions, many irrelevant <br />
people getting salty and offended on a whim <br />
for jokes that were once laughed off or dismissed without a scene
            </p>
            <p>
            Cancel culture is stupid and contradicts itself <br />
they tell you to speak your mind but not to an extent <br />
Freedom of speech is a facade <br />
you speak and you're targeted next <br />
you can't say what's on your mind without being labelled something else <br />
children and adults who don't know how to think for themselves <br />
tell you what to do and if you don't they take offense <br />
Seeking cultural appropriation, but the culture is a mess <br />
with so many different agendas, it would soon collapse on itself
            </p>
            <p>
            Too many cooks spoil the broth but no one listens <br />
They all put their ingredients without considering
that not everything is compatible <br />
few are oppositions <br />
and mixing together would just create less cohesion <br />
We need wisdom cause we lack vision <br />
Always thinking about the present, but never about the future <br />
We take short term goals over long term success <br />
We'd rather have it now than wait a few more years <br />
Patience is the key, success is the door <br />
haste is a lock pick that won't help in the long run <br />
The door might open for a while, but would eventually lock up <br />
now you're stuck and without the key, there's no where else to run <br />
you've seen the promised land, but it's always out of reach <br />
near success syndrome is what you've managed to achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
            Everyone talks, few hear and even fewer listen <br />
the key to getting isn't always recieving <br />
if you hoard it all, are you truly living <br />
or are you a machine whose only goal is to keep things <br />
we struggle everyday in multiple ways <br />
life isn't a bed of roses, it gives and also takes <br />
we're running out of time, every second might be our last <br />
the play is rounding up, make sure your acting's up to par <br />
we're all unpaid actors and this is our final act.
            </p>
