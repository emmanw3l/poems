      <p>
        It pains me to see that you never fully recovered, <br />
        What once was but now isn’t still left a scar you couldn’t cover, <br />
        I loved you dearly, and still do but we were never meant for each other,{" "}
        <br />I hope you heal, I really do, cause this pain you shouldn’t
        suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
        You said my name is in your autocorrect, I hope it’s a fleeting member,{" "}
        <br />I hope you move on from what we had, I hope you find someone
        better, <br />
        I didn’t deserve you, I never did and I’m sorry for our chapter, <br />
        For both our sakes, I hope you do move on and find your happily ever
        after.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as time passes, my name will slowly fade, your autocorrect would
        barely remember, <br />
        And I would be replaced, my place in your heart reclaimed by the one
        who’d treat you tender, <br />
        You’d look back at the time we spent and it’d no longer hurt to
        remember, <br />
        For though I left a scar, you healed it up and now your life is so much
        better.
