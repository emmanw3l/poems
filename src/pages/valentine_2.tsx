            <p>
            Love is in the air <br />
But I'm clearly immune <br />
Even if it was a snare <br />
I won't be caught in it's teeth <br />
Cupid shot and missed <br />
Love just isn't for me <br />
And the love that's in my heart is as dead as can be
            </p>
            <p>
            Valentine is around the corner <br />
But no dating for me <br />
It's a chance to show someone you love em, <br />
But nobody's for me
            </p>
            <p>
            Love is in the air, but my gas mask is in hand <br />
            As soon as it is near, it'd go over my mouth
            </p>
            <p>
            I'm happy for the ones that get to see their love, <br />
Or crush, or someone that they had something for, <br />
I pray that it leads to something more <br />
and you stay together, defying all odds
            </p>
            <p>
            But that's not me, I've given up, <br />
Been used so many times, I'm like a broken product <br />
Love isn't for everyone, <br />
So I write this hoping I'm the only one that it's not for
            </p>
