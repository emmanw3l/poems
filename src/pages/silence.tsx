      <p>
        Silence, <br />
        My ever present friend <br />
        Always giving me a shoulder to cry on whenever I need help <br />
        No judgement or hatred, what a comforting friend <br />
        Always looking after me like a guardian angel
      </p>
      <p>
        Never discriminating <br />
        Just love no hating <br />
        Always accepting <br />
        Like a magnet to stray pins <br />
        Never abusive or anything negative <br />
        Perfect like all things strive to be
      </p>
      <p>
        Come to think of it, <br />
        Do I even exist? <br />
        I have a lonely existence if silence is my best friend <br />
        The friendship we share is one that has seen tears <br />
        And I wonder what would happen if it came to an end <br />
        I've shared my worst fears and all of my cares <br />
        It knows just how I feel inside and always lends an ear
      </p>
      <p>
        But now I'm wondering does it even exist? <br />
        I know it's always there but that's when no one speaks <br />
        I know it always cares but can't seem to say a thing <br />
        I wish it would but if it did <br />
        Silence won't be it niche <br />
        Or maybe I'm wrong or genuinely confused
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know anybody <br />
        And nobody knows me
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish I could talk about it <br />
        But nobody would listen <br />
        Hence the reason I'm soliloquizing <br />
        In an attempt to break free
      </p>
      <p>
        If I talk about it <br />
        Then I'd get the strength to leave <br />
        But if I don't <br />
        Depression would slowly creep in
      </p>
      <p>
        So I lie to myself and say it's for the best <br />
        Why I did I don't know <br />
        But it's not like anyone cares
      </p>
      <p>
        My mind's all messed up since I consider silence a friend <br />
        But if I don't then there's no one else <br />
        Silence is all I have left
      </p>
